GraphQL is a new API standard that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST. At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API. Instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.

Improvements:
=============
* Less data usage
** No need to setup specific attribute nodes - underfetching
** Alternatively, no download of full data used partially - overfetching
* UI agnostic
* Data is requested by need, not by how the features were developed - so changing APIs is easier

Core concepts:
==============
* SDL - Schema definition language
* Single endpoint
* Mutations - create, update, delete
* Subscriptions to events
