What GraphQL means for the server
================================
* Focus on getting the data, not how to implement specific endpoints for UIs
  - By taking care of the algorithm for responding to queries.

* Can support batch processing for requests to avoid contacting the server too much by gathering all requests and choosing the right fetch strategy.

Some implementations
====================
* graphql-yoga: Fully-featured GraphQL server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience. It is built on top of Express, apollo-server, graphql-js and more.
* Prisma: GraphQL database proxy that turns your database into a GraphQL API. This API provides powerful, realtime CRUD operations for your data model.
* graphql-config & GraphQL CLI: Tooling to improve various GraphQL-related worfklows.
* GraphQL bindings: A convenient way of working with a GraphQL API. The binding generates dedicated JavaScript functions for each API operation.
* GraphQL Playground: “GraphQL IDE” that allows to interactively explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending queries and mutations to it. It’s somewhat similar to Postman which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs. Among other things, a GraphQL Playground…
  - … auto-generates a comprehensive documentation for all available API operations.
  - … provides an editor where you can write queries, mutations & subscriptions, with auto-completion(!) and syntax highlighting.
  - … lets you easily share your API operations.
